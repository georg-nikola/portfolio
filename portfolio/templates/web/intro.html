                I am a self-taught Frontend Web Developer from Lahore, Pakistan. About
                three years ago is when I started my learning journey on how to make
                the web stunning and responsive. I have always been a curious
                individual, which is why I’d love to collaborate and do some
                real-world projects in order to flourish my skills. I'm not perfect,
                however. I'm very far from perfection, yet I'm resilient, assertive
                and stubborn and I find learning a fascinating process. I am currently
                learning about PWAs and my future plan is to learn about ML for Web
                Performance.

                    I believe simplicity is undervalued and therefore strive to make things as simple as possible. I am

                    experience.

                        tend to code things from scratch and enjoy bringing ideas to life.
